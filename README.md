# DopaminChatter
Dopamin is the happiness hormone. What's better than a Twitch Chat with **great Emote Usage** and **Emote Chains** (same Emotes after another). That's the reason why this bot exists!
</br>
</br>
## How does it work?
If a User Message contains a specific Emote (specified by Channel Owner) there is an percentage Chance that the DopaminChatter sends a Message with the same Emote. This opens the Opportunity for Emote Chains. üî•
</br>
</br>
## Bot Setup
To enable the Bot for your Channel, just go to **[my Twitch Chat](https://twitch.tv/jakkoble)** (a follow would not hurt üòâ) and write `#register`. After registration, the Bot automatically joins your Channel. Now you are able to setup the Bot in your own Channel Chat with the **Commands**.
